# 🤝 Contributing to LeetCode Community Solutions

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🚀
This repository is built to help students learn Data Structures & Algorithms by sharing clean, readable, and well-explained LeetCode solutions.

Please read the guidelines carefully before submitting a Pull Request.

---

## 📌 Before You Start

* Check if the problem already exists in the repository
* Follow the folder structure strictly
* Write clean and readable code
* Add comments wherever necessary
* Mention Time & Space Complexity

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

We follow **Topic-based organization**:

```
/Java/<Topic>/ProblemName.java
/Python/<Topic>/ProblemName.py
/CPP/<Topic>/ProblemName.cpp
```

### Example

```
/Java/Arrays/TwoSum.java
/Python/Math/Palindrome.py
/CPP/LinkedList/ReverseLinkedList.cpp
```

If a topic folder does not exist → create it.

---

## 🧠 Solution File Format

Every solution file MUST start with:

```java
// Problem: Two Sum
// Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
// Topic: Arrays
// Difficulty: Easy
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)
```

---

## 🌿 Branch Naming Rule

Do NOT commit directly to the `main` branch.

Create a branch using this format:

```
add-problemname-language
```

### Examples

```
add-two-sum-java
add-valid-parentheses-python
add-reverse-linkedlist-cpp
```

---

## 🛠 Steps to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a new branch
4. Add your solution
5. Commit changes
6. Push branch
7. Create Pull Request
